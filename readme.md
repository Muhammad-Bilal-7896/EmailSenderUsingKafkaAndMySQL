```bash
docker compose up -d
```

After runnning the above command, the project will be started as follows

1. Front End at : [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
2. Producer at: [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)
3. Database MySQL will be running.

- If you want to stop the docker then run the followig:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Testing the BackEnd Seperately

After the project is running from docker as mentioned earlier you will see producer running at :
[http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/). You can also test the producer as follows:
On PostMan add a new **POST** request at the URL: [http://localhost:3001/email/produceEmail](http://localhost:3001/email/produceEmail) with the following JSON body

```json
{
  "to": "bialmohib7896@gmail.com",
  "numEmails": 3000,
  "subject": "Determination in programming",
  "body": "<p>This is a test email sent using the <strong>Nest.js Email Service.</strong></p>"
}
```

And send the request. If sent successfully you will see the following response:

```bash
{
    "message": "Congratulations 🎉! Emails sent successfully to the Kafka topic: medium.rocks",
    "status": 200
}
```

To verify if emails are being sent please navigate to the consumer terminal and there you will find that each and every email sent by producer is being consumed by consumer and then the status of it is also updated in the mysql database table in email table.
